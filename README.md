How to Use
----------

All of this has only been tested on Windows, because of the different methods needed to change the wallpapers on different OS I doubt it would work, but who knows...

The only thing you need is the RedditWallpaper.jar
If the program doesn't run just by double clicking it, you might need to download Java (1.7 would work best). http://www.java.com/
Once you have Java installed, run the RedditWallpaper.jar by right clicking it and choosing open with, then navigate to: C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\javaw.exe
or to where ever Java was installed. If you are getting a black command promt box flashing up but nothing else happening, make sure you are running with javaw.exe rather than java.exe.

In all likely-hood you will already have Java installed and it will automatically know how to run the file.

The program itself is pretty straight forward to use. In the top box you can enter the name of any subreddit, or combinations of subreddits joined with a +.

The second box is the folder in which all the wallpapers will be downloaded to, **please make sure this folder exists** if the program is told to run but does nothing.

The two dropdown boxes work much like the browsing modes on reddit do.

You can move the slider to change the delay between wallpapers changing.

The number of links to read before going back to the top can be set with the last field. Note that not all links can be read (I am working on getting more of them to work) but this means the program may skip some images if it doesn't understand the format.

Once you have sorted the options above, simply press start and the program will run. The stop button will halt everything. (Keeping the last wallpaper as the desktop background).

It is also worth noting the images will be positioned with the settings that the normal windows control panel settings have, for best results (in my opinion) try using the "fit" setting.
